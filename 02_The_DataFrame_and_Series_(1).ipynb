        "A Series index serves as labels for the values. A single **label** or **name** always references a single value. In the above image, the index label **3** corresponds with the value 667. The Series index is virtually identical to the DataFrame index, so the same rules apply to it. Index values can be duplicated and can be types other than integers, such as strings. \n",
